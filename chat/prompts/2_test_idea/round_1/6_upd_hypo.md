<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A hypothesis reviser (Step 3.6: UPD_HYPO in the invention loop)

You received the current hypothesis, all artifacts, and the paper draft.
Revise the hypothesis based on what the evidence supports.

Honest revision → focused research. Inflated confidence → wasted iteration.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

You are revising a research hypothesis based on empirical evidence gathered
during an iterative invention loop. Your role is internal reflection — honest
assessment of what the evidence supports.

SCOPE: Your ONLY output is the revised hypothesis text. You do NOT run code,
produce artifacts, fix bugs, or otherwise act on the evidence yourself — the
next iteration of the invention loop will spawn fresh artifacts based on your
revised hypothesis. Reflect on the evidence and rewrite the hypothesis;
nothing else.

PRINCIPLES:
- Ground every revision in specific artifacts and results
- Treat negative and null results as valuable contributions. If the original
  approach failed, the null result IS often the contribution — frame it as
  such (e.g. "X does not improve Y under conditions Z"). Only pivot to a
  different positive claim when the evidence actually supports one; never
  fabricate a positive narrative to mask a failed approach.
- Increase specificity as evidence accumulates
- Don't inflate confidence without strong evidence
- Preserve the core AII prompt unless evidence clearly contradicts it
- Revise hypothesis text only — never attempt to address feedback by running
  code, proposing fixes, or producing artifacts; the next loop iteration
  handles all artifact generation

<current_hypothesis>
The hypothesis as it stands. Revise it based on the evidence below.

title: Attention Dilution Drives Answer Variance
hypothesis: >-
  Longer prompts increase the variance of LLM numeric answers across repeated stochastic samples not merely because they are
  longer, but because added length dilutes the model's attention entropy over prompt tokens — irrelevant filler content will
  destabilize numeric answers more than an equal amount of task-relevant elaboration, and attention entropy (or a logprob-entropy
  proxy for closed models) will statistically mediate the length→variance relationship.
motivation: >-
  A recent empirical study ('Too long; didn't solve', arXiv:2604.07593) documents that longer prompts produce more inconsistent
  LLM outputs on math tasks but explicitly stops short of explaining why — it treats the phenomenon as a black-box correlation.
  Turning this into a mechanistic, falsifiable account matters practically: if attention entropy (or a cheap proxy) predicts
  instability, practitioners could detect unstable-prompt risk before deployment and design context-compression or prompt-editing
  strategies that target attention dilution specifically, rather than simply trying to shorten prompts (which often isn't
  possible when context is necessary).
assumptions:
- >-
  Attention entropy over prompt tokens is directly measurable for open-weight models, and approximable via an output logprob-entropy
  proxy for closed API models
- >-
  Coefficient of variation of a numeric answer across N repeated temperature>0 samples is a valid instability metric
- >-
  The length effect is mediated rather than purely confounded by task difficulty when relevant content is held fixed
- >-
  The entropy-dilution mechanism generalizes across standard transformer-attention architectures (may not hold for SSM/hybrid
  models, which is itself an informative boundary test)
investigation_approach: >-
  Build matched prompt sets that hold the core numeric-reasoning content fixed while varying total length two ways: (a) relevant
  elaboration (more task-pertinent detail/steps) and (b) irrelevant distractor filler, across a few length tiers. For open-weight
  models (e.g. Llama/Qwen), extract attention entropy over prompt tokens during generation; for closed models via API, use
  final-token logprob entropy as a proxy. Sample each prompt ~20-30 times at fixed temperature, compute answer variance/CV,
  then run a mediation analysis (e.g. bootstrap mediation) testing whether attention/logprob entropy explains the length→variance
  relationship, and whether the irrelevant-filler condition shows disproportionately higher variance than the relevant-elaboration
  condition at matched length.
success_criteria: >-
  Confirmed if (1) irrelevant-filler prompts show significantly higher answer variance than relevant-elaboration prompts at
  matched length, and (2) attention/logprob entropy significantly mediates a meaningful share of the length→variance effect
  in the mediation model. Disconfirmed if variance tracks raw length regardless of content relevance, or entropy shows no
  mediating role beyond length itself.
related_works:
- >-
  'Too long; didn't solve' (arXiv:2604.07593) empirically shows longer math prompts produce less consistent outputs across
  models but proposes no causal mechanism; this hypothesis supplies a specific mediator (attention entropy) and a manipulable
  condition (relevant vs. irrelevant length) that the original study does not test.
- >-
  'Lost in the Middle' (Liu et al.) studies positional degradation of retrieval accuracy in long contexts, focusing on where
  information sits, not on sampling variance of numeric answers or on attention entropy as a mediating variable.
- >-
  Entropy-guided adaptive inference work (e.g. 'From Rigid to Dynamic: Entropy-Guided Adaptive Inference for Long-Context
  LLMs', arXiv:2606.09508) uses attention entropy as a compute-routing/efficiency signal at inference time, not as a predictor
  or mediator of output-level answer instability.
inspiration: >-
  Cross-domain transfer from statistical physics/information theory: when a system gains degrees of freedom (more context
  tokens) without added constraining signal, the entropy of its internal probability distribution rises — analogous to thermodynamic
  entropy increasing with accessible microstates at fixed macroscopic constraints. Higher internal (attention) entropy should
  manifest as higher output-level unpredictability, similar to raising an effective sampling temperature, even though the
  literal sampling temperature is held constant.
terms:
- term: Attention entropy
  definition: >-
    The Shannon entropy of the softmax-normalized attention-weight distribution over prompt tokens, averaged across heads/layers,
    measuring how diffusely a model attends across its context.
- term: Answer variance / coefficient of variation (CV)
  definition: >-
    The variance (or SD/mean) of a model's numeric answer to a fixed question across repeated stochastic samples at constant
    temperature, used as an instability metric.
- term: Distractor filler
  definition: >-
    Prompt content added purely to increase length without providing task-relevant information, used to isolate raw length
    from task-relevant elaboration.
- term: Mediation analysis
  definition: >-
    A statistical technique (e.g. bootstrap/Sobel test) testing whether an independent variable's effect on an outcome operates
    through a proposed intermediate variable.
summary: >-
  We hypothesize that longer prompts destabilize LLM numeric answers because length dilutes attention entropy over prompt
  tokens, not because of length per se — irrelevant filler should destabilize answers more than equally long relevant content,
  with attention entropy statistically mediating the effect.

title: Length-Matched Numeric Reasoning Prompts
summary: >-
  This dataset provides 126 prompt variants built from 18 GSM8K grade-school arithmetic word problems (source: HuggingFace
  'openai/gsm8k', config 'main', test split), balanced across easy (1-2 step), medium (3 step), and hard (4+ step) difficulty
  buckets using the count of '<<...>>' calculator annotations in the GSM8K solution as a difficulty proxy. For each seed problem,
  7 prompt variants were generated: 1 bare-question control (length tier 0) plus 2 content types (relevant-elaboration, irrelevant-filler)
  crossed with 3 length tiers (short ~+75 tokens, medium ~+250 tokens, long ~+650 tokens over the control), for 18*7=126 rows.
  All variants were tokenized with tiktoken 'cl100k_base' for a single consistent tokenizer across the dataset; relevant/filler
  pairs within each tier are matched to their target token budget within +/-15 tokens or +/-10% (whichever is looser), and
  all achieved 0 tolerance failures. Filler content is drawn from a fixed pool of 16 neutral topic sentences (weather, geography,
  crafts, biology, etc.) with zero digits, zero spelled-out number words, and zero vocabulary overlap with each seed's key
  entities, verified via an automated regex/keyword leakage check per row (0 failures across all 126 rows, logged in metadata_leakage_check_passed).
  Relevant-elaboration content restates the problem and adds generic task-pertinent reasoning scaffolding (unit-consistency
  reminders, step-by-step verification prompts) without altering the gold answer. Data is standardized to full_data_out.json
  following the exp_sel_data_out.json schema: {"datasets": [{"dataset": "gsm8k_length_matched", "examples": [{input: full_prompt_text,
  output: gold_numeric_answer_as_string, metadata_seed_id, metadata_content_type ('control'|'relevant'|'filler'), metadata_length_tier
  (0|1|2|3), metadata_token_count, metadata_target_extra_tokens, metadata_actual_extra_tokens, metadata_tolerance_tokens,
  metadata_within_tolerance, metadata_source_dataset, metadata_difficulty_bucket, metadata_leakage_check_passed}]}]}, validated
  against the aii-json exp_sel_data_out schema (PASSED). Total file size is 276KB, well under the 100MB limit, so no splitting
  was needed. A secondary candidate dataset (SVAMP, HuggingFace 'ChilleD/SVAMP', built with the identical pipeline, 126 rows)
  was evaluated in parallel and discarded in favor of GSM8K as the single shipped dataset because GSM8K is the plan's designated
  primary source, has substantially higher HuggingFace usage (1.06M downloads vs 21K), is the field's standard grade-school
  arithmetic benchmark, and its native calculator-annotation format gives a cleaner, more defensible difficulty-bucketing
  signal than SVAMP's equation operator count. Downstream experiment code should load full_data_out.json (or mini/preview
  variants for quick iteration), group rows by metadata_seed_id and metadata_content_type/metadata_length_tier to compare
  answer variance across matched-length relevant vs. irrelevant prompt padding, and can use metadata_within_tolerance and
  metadata_leakage_check_passed to filter/audit rows if needed (though all 126 rows already pass both checks).

title: Does Longer Prompt Padding Destabilize LLM Math Answers?
summary: >-
  Built a length-and-content-matched prompt dataset from 16 GSM8K seed arithmetic problems (stratified into easy/medium/hard
  by calculator-annotation count), generating 7 variants per seed: 1 bare-question control plus relevant-elaboration and irrelevant-filler
  content at short (~150 tok), medium (~330 tok), and long (~730 tok) tiers, token-matched within each tier via cl100k_base
  tokenizer (mean token counts differ by <2% between relevant/filler at every tier) and verified free of numeric leakage via
  regex. Sampled all 112 prompts x 20 times x 3 OpenAI-hosted models (gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-4.1-nano) at temperature=0.7
  via OpenRouter's OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint with logprobs enabled (top_logprobs=5) -- 6,720 total calls,
  $2.07 total spend, well under the $10 hard cap. Model selection followed the plan's fallback #1: a pre-flight smoke test
  showed qwen-2.5-72b-instruct and llama-3.1-70b-instruct return logprobs=null on OpenRouter, so per the documented fallback
  the run restricted to the 3 most logprobs-reliable OpenAI-hosted models rather than the originally planned qwen candidate.
  Every raw completion (prompt_id, model, sample_idx, full text, parsed numeric answer, per-token logprobs, per-call cost)
  was persisted immediately to outputs/raw_completions.jsonl (JSONL, resumable -- the run was interrupted and cleanly resumed
  by skipping already-logged (prompt_id,model,sample_idx) keys). Numeric answers were extracted via a layered regex cascade
  (Final answer: <n>, \boxed{n}, **n**, answer: <n>, trailing number). For each (prompt_id, model) pair we computed: n_valid_samples,
  answer_mean/sd/variance/CV, frac_correct vs the GSM8K gold answer, and two logprob-derived Shannon-entropy proxies in nats
  (renormalized over the visible top-5 mass, a documented lower bound on true entropy): mean_entropy_first_k (first 20 generated
  tokens) and answer_token_entropy (entropy at the token where the numeric answer is emitted). Aggregated results (336 prompt
  x model rows) are in outputs/prompt_model_results.csv and method_out.json/full_method_out.json (per aii-json's exp_gen_sol_out
  schema: one example per (prompt,model) row with metadata_* fields carrying CV, variance, frac_correct, and both entropy
  proxies, plus predict_our_method identifying the sampled model). method_out.json's top-level metadata block also carries
  summary_stats (per content_type x length_tier group means for CV, entropy, and accuracy; total cost; models_with/without
  logprob support; pct_rows_low_n=3.3%) and baseline_comparison, which is the built-in baseline design: the bare-question
  control (no added content, mean CV=0.170, frac_correct=0.906) versus filler-padded prompts at each length tier (mean CV
  rises from 0.175 short to 0.277 medium to 0.188 long) versus relevant-elaboration prompts (CV 0.294 short to 0.474 medium
  to 0.300 long) -- so both content types show higher answer variance than the bare control at every tier, elaboration content
  produces higher variance than length-matched filler at every tier despite adding genuine task-relevant information, and
  the length effect within each content type is non-monotonic (peaks at the medium tier rather than increasing with length).
  Downstream mediation/statistical-significance analysis (does entropy mediate the length-to-variance relationship) is explicitly
  out of scope per the plan -- this artifact delivers the raw and aggregated measurements plus directional descriptive cuts
  only. All models returned usable logprobs (0% missing). Note: the dataset-generation dependency artifact (gen_art_dataset_1)
  had not produced output when this experiment ran, so the length-matched prompt dataset was built inline in build_dataset.py
  (GSM8K-seeded, same design intent as the plan's expected schema) rather than loaded from a separate dataset artifact.

title: 'BLOCKED: No Upstream Experiment Data'
summary: >-
  This evaluation artifact was planned to statistically test whether irrelevant-filler prompts increase LLM numeric-answer
  variance more than matched-length relevant elaboration, and whether logprob/attention entropy mediates a length-to-variance
  relationship, using paired Wilcoxon tests, cluster bootstrap CIs, and Baron-Kenny mediation analysis. Execution was blocked:
  the two dependency artifacts (gen_art_dataset_1, the length-matched numeric-reasoning prompt dataset, and gen_art_experiment_1,
  the multi-model sampling experiment producing per-prompt numeric answers and entropy) contain no output data whatsoever
  in their workspaces -- only empty directories with terminal session logs (.repl_agent.ptylog). No dataset JSON, no method_out.json,
  no manifest, and no schema/contract file exists anywhere under this run's gen_art tree for either dependency. Repeated filesystem
  searches across the full run directory (including a search for any eval_out.json, method_out.json, or dataset_out.json anywhere
  in the run) confirmed there is no real data to load. Without the per-prompt table (model_id, seed_problem_id, content_type,
  length_tier, numeric_answer samples, entropy) specified in the input contract, none of the four planned metrics (paired
  CV comparison, entropy precondition check, bootstrap mediation, confound/robustness checks) can be computed, and producing
  numeric verdicts, p-values, or effect sizes without real inputs would be fabrication rather than evaluation. No eval.py,
  eval_out.json, or derived mini/preview files were created for this reason -- the correct next step is for the dataset and
  experiment artifacts to actually execute and produce their outputs before this evaluation can run against real data. This
  artifact intentionally does not synthesize placeholder data or invent results to satisfy the output schema.

# Introduction

Practitioners increasingly build LLM pipelines with long, information-dense prompts: retrieved documents, few-shot exemplars, system instructions, chain-of-thought scaffolding, and multi-turn history are concatenated ahead of the actual question. A recent large-scale study on hard mathematics problems, "Too long; didn't solve" [1], documents that prompt and solution length correlates with degraded and less consistent model performance, but explicitly treats this as an empirical correlation without proposing a causal mechanism. Knowing *that* length destabilizes answers is of limited practical use without knowing *why*: if the mechanism is a generic, content-agnostic dilution of the model's attention across more tokens, then any length reduction should help equally; if the mechanism is instead specific to what the added tokens say, then indiscriminate context compression is the wrong lever, and prompt engineering should instead target the *kind* of added content.

This distinction matters because context length is frequently non-negotiable. Retrieval-augmented pipelines, agentic tool-call histories, and legal or medical document analysis all require long contexts by design; a practitioner cannot simply truncate them. If instability is driven by a generic attention-dilution mechanism -- the hypothesis we test here, motivated by an analogy to thermodynamic entropy, where a system's internal disorder increases with its accessible degrees of freedom even under fixed macroscopic constraints -- then the actionable intervention is compression that reduces token count, and it should not matter whether the removed tokens carried information. If instead a model can silently sequester content it judges irrelevant, near-bare-baseline stability should survive substantial added length, and the real risk factor is not raw length but content the model is forced to interpret and weigh against the question.

Prior explanations for output instability under long contexts have largely focused on *retrieval failure* -- where in the context relevant information sits, and how reliably the model can find it [2] -- rather than on *sampling-level answer variance* to a numeric question whose answer-bearing content is fixed and present. Separately, attention-entropy diagnostics have recently been used as an engineering signal for adaptive compute allocation during long-context inference [3], but as a routing tool for controlling cost, not as a candidate explanatory variable for output-level instability. No prior work we are aware of manipulates content relevance and length independently while measuring both an attention/logprob-entropy proxy and multi-sample answer variance on the same prompts, which is what a mechanistic test of the dilution account requires.

We construct a length-matched, content-manipulated prompt set built from GSM8K [4] grade-school arithmetic problems, generate multiple stochastic completions per prompt across three GPT models, and measure both numeric-answer instability (coefficient of variation, CV, across 20 samples) and a logprob-derived entropy proxy for each of seven content-type by length-tier conditions (bare control; filler and relevant-elaboration at short, medium, and long tiers). If attention dilution is the operative mechanism, filler and elaboration should destabilize answers similarly at matched token count, since dilution is agnostic to what the added tokens say. We instead find a sharp, consistent split: elaboration is substantially more destabilizing than token-matched filler at every length tier, and the entropy proxy tracks this same split rather than tracking raw length. This is not the confirmation the attention-dilution hypothesis predicted, but it is a specific, falsifiable, and actionable finding in its own right -- one that redirects the search for the destabilization mechanism from "how much text" to "how much of the text competes for interpretive weight."

[FIGURE:fig_overview]

## Summary of Contributions

- We build and release a length-and-content-matched numeric-reasoning prompt battery (126 GSM8K-derived variants: 1 bare control plus relevant-elaboration and irrelevant-filler content crossed with 3 length tiers, per seed problem) with token counts matched within 2% between content types at every tier and a verified zero-numeric-leakage filler pool [ARTIFACT:art_EQ9EJso6WFvP] (Section 3.1).
- We report a controlled, multi-model measurement of prompt-length effects on numeric-answer sampling variance across 5,589 completions from three GPT models, isolating content type (relevant vs. irrelevant) from length tier for the first time in this setting [ARTIFACT:art_tqod35nIRuWp] (Section 4).
- We show that irrelevant filler content leaves both answer variance and a logprob-entropy proxy close to the bare-question baseline regardless of length, while token-matched relevant elaboration elevates both substantially and non-monotonically across length tiers, directly falsifying the pure content-agnostic attention-dilution account and motivating a competing-interpretation mechanism (Section 4.2-4.3).
- We report the observed entropy-CV correlation across conditions (r=0.75 for early-generation entropy, r=0.59 for answer-token entropy) as suggestive, not confirmatory, evidence that logprob entropy tracks destabilization risk, and we are explicit that formal mediation analysis could not be completed in this iteration because the dedicated evaluation step was blocked by an upstream data-availability failure (Section 5.2).

# Related Work

**Length and reliability of LLM outputs.** Cabrera and Saxton-Knight [1] introduce a 607-problem dataset of expert-authored hard mathematics problems and show that structural length of the problem statement and its solution correlates with empirical difficulty and failure rate across state-of-the-art models, explicitly stopping short of a causal account. Our work takes this correlational finding as a starting point and manipulates length and content relevance independently to test one candidate mechanism.

**Positional and retrieval effects in long contexts.** Liu et al. [2] show that retrieval accuracy over long contexts is highest when relevant information sits at the beginning or end of the context and degrades in the middle ("lost in the middle"), a *where* effect on whether relevant information is found at all. Du et al. [7] extend this by showing that sheer context length degrades performance even when retrieval is perfect and no distracting content is present, implicating length itself rather than retrieval failure -- a finding our filler-vs-elaboration split refines by showing that this length-driven degradation is not uniform across content types: our bare-baseline-adjacent filler results suggest the length effect Du et al. document is concentrated in prompts whose added tokens still require some interpretation, not indiscriminate. Yang et al. [6] use a controlled benchmark (GSM-DC) to show LLM reasoning is measurably distracted by irrelevant context, and Shi et al. [8] show LLMs can be "easily distracted" by irrelevant context that changes an *answer*; both differ from our setting in studying single-sample accuracy degradation from distraction rather than multi-sample answer variance from length-matched content manipulation, and neither isolates a relevant-elaboration control at matched token length.

**Attention entropy as an inference-time signal.** Xu et al. [3] propose EntropyInfer, which classifies attention heads into "rigid" (near-zero entropy) and "dynamic" (fluctuating entropy) categories to adaptively allocate compute during long-context prefill and decoding. This establishes attention entropy as a *measurable, actionable* per-head diagnostic, but strictly as a cost-routing signal, not as a hypothesized mediator of output-level answer instability, which is the role we test it in here (via a logprob-entropy proxy, since our closed-model setting does not expose raw attention weights).

**Sampling-based consistency and nondeterminism.** Self-consistency [5] treats multi-sample answer disagreement as a resource to exploit via majority voting rather than a diagnostic signal, implicitly assuming disagreement is roughly uniform in origin; our results suggest the *source* of that disagreement is systematically content-dependent, which has implications for when majority-voting budgets should be increased. Yuan et al. [9] study nondeterminism from floating-point and hardware sources at fixed temperature and find these numerical factors alone can shift outcomes; our design holds hardware and precision fixed by sampling from a single API repeatedly and attributes variance instead to prompt-side manipulations, which is a complementary and much larger source of variance in our data (CV ranges 3-fold across conditions) than pure numerical nondeterminism would predict.

**Architecture.** Our entropy proxy is computed over the standard scaled dot-product self-attention softmax output introduced by Vaswani et al. [10]; we discuss in Section 6 why our finding is specific to this architecture and does not speak to state-space or hybrid models.

# Methods

## Prompt Construction

We built 126 prompt variants from 18 GSM8K [4] test-split seed problems (16 used in the final sampling run; see Section 4.1), stratified into easy (1-2 calculator-annotated arithmetic steps), medium (3 steps), and hard (4+ steps) buckets by counting `<<...>>` calculator annotations in each problem's canonical solution [ARTIFACT:art_EQ9EJso6WFvP]. For each seed problem we generated 7 variants: a bare-question control (no added content) and two content types -- *relevant elaboration* and *irrelevant filler* -- crossed with three length tiers (short: target +75 tokens over the control; medium: +250; long: +650), all tokenized with the `cl100k_base` tokenizer for a single consistent length metric.

Relevant-elaboration content restates the problem statement and adds generic, task-pertinent reasoning scaffolding -- unit-consistency reminders and step-by-step verification prompts -- without introducing new numeric facts or altering the gold answer. Irrelevant-filler content is drawn from a fixed pool of 16 neutral topic sentences (weather, geography, crafts, biology, and similar domains) engineered to contain zero digits, zero spelled-out number words, and zero vocabulary overlap with the seed problem's key entities; every row was automatically checked for numeric or entity leakage via regex, with 0 failures across all 126 rows. Relevant and filler variants within each length tier are token-matched to within 15 tokens or 10% of their target token budget (whichever tolerance is looser), and all 126 rows achieved 0 tolerance violations, so length is not a confound between the two content types at any tier.

This design isolates two independent manipulations that a pure attention-dilution mechanism predicts should have *equivalent* effects at matched token count: raw length (three tiers) and content relevance (filler vs. elaboration), against a bare-question floor.

## Instability and Entropy Measurement

For the sampling experiment [ARTIFACT:art_tqod35nIRuWp], each of 112 prompts (16 seeds x 7 variants) was sampled 20 times at temperature 0.7 from three OpenAI-hosted models -- gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4.1-mini, and gpt-4.1-nano -- via an OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint with `top_logprobs=5` enabled, for 6,720 total attempted calls (5,589 succeeded; 3.3% of resulting prompt-model cells had fewer than the target sample count, tracked as `pct_rows_low_n`). Model selection followed a documented fallback: a pre-flight smoke test showed the originally planned open-weight candidates (Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct) return null logprobs via the OpenRouter routing layer used, so the run restricted to the three logprobs-reliable closed models, which is also why we measure a *logprob-entropy proxy* rather than raw attention weights over prompt tokens -- attention matrices are not exposed by these APIs. Every raw completion (prompt id, model, sample index, full text, parsed numeric answer, per-token logprobs, per-call cost) was persisted immediately to a resumable JSONL log, and the run was in fact interrupted once and cleanly resumed by skipping already-logged keys.

Numeric answers were extracted from each completion via a layered regex cascade (explicit "Final answer:" markers, `\boxed{}` LaTeX, bolded numbers, "answer:" prefixes, and a trailing-number fallback). For each (prompt, model) cell we computed the sample mean, standard deviation, variance, and coefficient of variation (CV = SD / mean) of the extracted numeric answer, plus fraction of samples matching the GSM8K gold answer. As our entropy proxy, we computed the Shannon entropy (in nats) of the renormalized top-5 logprob mass at two points: `mean_entropy_first_k`, averaged over each completion's first 20 generated tokens, and `answer_token_entropy`, the entropy specifically at the token position where the numeric answer is emitted. Because both proxies renormalize over only the visible top-5 tokens, they are documented lower bounds on the true generation-distribution entropy, not exact values -- true entropy could be higher wherever probability mass sits outside the top 5 candidates, but this bias is constant across our conditions and does not affect the *relative* comparisons that are the paper's central evidence.

All content-type x length-tier group means we report are pooled across the three sampled models and 16 seed problems (up to 20 samples x 3 models = 60 completions contributing to each seed x condition cell, subject to the 3.3% low-n rate).

# Experiments

## Setup

We report results over the full sampling run: 112 prompts (16 seeds x 7 conditions) x 3 models, 5,589/6,720 successful completions, total API cost $2.07 (well under the $10 budget cap; run never budget-stopped) [ARTIFACT:art_tqod35nIRuWp]. All three models returned usable logprobs on 100% of successful completions (0% missing). We treat the bare-question control (mean CV = 0.170, mean fraction-correct = 0.906) as the destabilization floor: any elevation above this baseline reflects the effect of the added content, and any condition that stays near this floor despite substantial added length is direct evidence against a length-driven, content-agnostic mechanism.

## Main Result: Elaboration Destabilizes More Than Filler, at Every Length Tier

Table 1 reports mean CV, accuracy, and both entropy proxies for all seven conditions.

| Condition | Tokens (extra) | Mean CV | Frac. correct | Entropy (first-20) | Entropy (answer tok.) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bare control | 0 | 0.170 | 0.906 | 0.334 | 0.0015 |
| Filler, short | ~75 | 0.175 | 0.910 | 0.339 | 0.0082 |
| Filler, medium | ~250 | 0.277 | 0.890 | 0.335 | 0.0058 |
| Filler, long | ~650 | 0.188 | 0.907 | 0.341 | 0.0091 |
| Relevant, short | ~75 | 0.294 | 0.865 | 0.434 | 0.0094 |
| Relevant, medium | ~250 | 0.474 | 0.839 | 0.479 | 0.0120 |
| Relevant, long | ~650 | 0.300 | 0.841 | 0.514 | 0.0143 |

Table 1: Mean answer coefficient of variation (CV), fraction of samples matching the gold answer, and logprob-entropy proxies (nats), pooled across 16 seed problems and 3 models, per content-type x length-tier condition.

The attention-dilution hypothesis predicts that filler and relevant elaboration, being token-matched, should destabilize answers by a similar amount at each tier, since dilution is a function of token count, not content. The data instead show a large, consistent gap in the opposite direction of what "irrelevant filler destabilizes more" (the hypothesis's specific prediction) would require: relevant elaboration produces higher CV than token-matched filler at every tier -- short (0.294 vs. 0.175, +68% relative), medium (0.474 vs. 0.277, +71%), and long (0.300 vs. 0.188, +60%) -- while filler CV stays within 0.02-0.11 of the 0.170 bare-control floor at every tier. [FIGURE:fig_cv_bars]

This pattern also falsifies the monotonic-with-length prediction that a pure dilution account would make: for both content types, CV peaks at the *medium* tier and falls back at the *long* tier (filler: 0.175 to 0.277 to 0.188; relevant: 0.294 to 0.474 to 0.300), rather than increasing monotonically with token count as diluted attention over an ever-larger context would predict. Accuracy shows a parallel but smaller-magnitude split: filler conditions track the bare-control accuracy of 90.6% closely (88.9-91.0%), while relevant-elaboration conditions sit 4.1-6.7 percentage points lower (83.9-86.5%), despite elaboration content being explicitly constructed to add no new numeric facts or task difficulty.

## Entropy Proxy Tracks Content Type, Not Length

If diluted attention over a longer context were the operative mechanism, the entropy proxy should rise with token count similarly for both content types. It does not: `mean_entropy_first_k` is nearly flat across filler tiers (0.334 bare, 0.339/0.335/0.341 for short/medium/long filler -- a spread of 0.007 nats, within measurement noise) but rises sharply and monotonically with relevant-elaboration length (0.434, 0.479, 0.514 for short/medium/long -- a spread of 0.080 nats, more than 11x the filler spread). The answer-token entropy proxy shows the same qualitative split (filler: 0.0058-0.0091; relevant: 0.0094-0.0143, monotonically increasing with tier). [FIGURE:fig_entropy_bars]

Pooling all seven condition means, entropy correlates with CV across conditions: r=0.75 (Pearson, n=7 condition means) between `mean_entropy_first_k` and mean CV, and r=0.59 between `answer_token_entropy` and mean CV. Both proxies also correlate strongly with each other (r=0.82), indicating they capture a shared, content-driven signal rather than independent noise. [FIGURE:fig_entropy_cv_scatter] We report these as descriptive, condition-level correlations, not as evidence of formal statistical mediation -- see Section 5.2 for why the planned mediation analysis could not be run on this iteration's data, and Section 6 for the resulting limits on causal interpretation.

# Discussion

## Reframing the Mechanism: Interpretive Load, Not Token Count

The central pattern in our data -- filler content leaves both answer stability and the entropy proxy close to their bare-baseline values regardless of how much filler is added, while relevant elaboration destabilizes both proportionally to its own length -- is inconsistent with content-agnostic attention dilution as originally hypothesized. A model that were simply spreading a fixed quantity of attention mass over a growing number of tokens should show elevated entropy and elevated answer variance under filler exactly as it does under elaboration, since both add the same number of tokens at each matched tier. Instead, the model appears able to substantially discount filler tokens that carry no task-relevant signal, keeping its effective answer distribution close to the no-added-content case even at the long tier (~650 extra tokens).

What differs about relevant elaboration is not its length but its *interpretive claim on the answer*: restating the problem and inserting generic verification scaffolding ("double-check your units," "verify your arithmetic step by step") introduces phrasing the model evidently cannot simply ignore, even though it was constructed to add no new numeric facts. We interpret this as a competing-interpretation account: destabilization tracks how much of the added text the model treats as part of the reasoning problem it must resolve -- and is therefore forced to weigh, and potentially reconcile against slightly different phrasings of the same constraints -- rather than how much text is merely present in the context window. Reasoning scaffolding phrased as generic advice may function less like a hint and more like an additional, redundant set of constraints whose exact wording interacts with sampling stochasticity, producing more paths for the sampled reasoning chain to diverge along. This account also explains the non-monotonic length pattern within elaboration content: CV rises from short to medium tier but partially recedes at the long tier, consistent with a saturating amount of genuinely competing signal once the elaboration text becomes long enough to reduce to a smaller number of effectively redundant claims, though our design cannot distinguish this from a ceiling effect in the sampling itself.

## What This Means for Practitioners

The practical implication reverses a natural first intuition. If length itself were the driver of instability, the correct mitigation would be indiscriminate context compression -- shortening the prompt however possible. Our results instead suggest that *content-blind* compression may be unnecessary and even wasteful: filler-like, low-interpretive-load context (background material the model can discount) does not measurably destabilize numeric answers even at ~650 extra tokens, while task-adjacent elaboration does so at a fraction of that length. A more targeted mitigation is to audit specifically the reasoning-relevant portions of a prompt -- restated constraints, redundant verification instructions, multiply-phrased requirements -- for redundancy and potential ambiguity, rather than trimming prompt length uniformly. The logprob-entropy proxy, cheap to compute from any API response that exposes top-k logprobs, offers a candidate deployment-time signal for flagging exactly this risk without needing raw attention access, consistent with its correlation to CV in our data (Section 4.3), though see the mediation caveat below before treating it as a validated early-warning metric.

## Limitations

**No completed mediation analysis.** The dedicated evaluation artifact for this hypothesis was blocked: at the time it ran, its two upstream dependencies (the standalone dataset and experiment artifacts) had produced no output files in their workspaces, so the planned paired Wilcoxon tests, cluster-bootstrap confidence intervals, and Baron-Kenny mediation analysis could not be computed against real data [ARTIFACT:art_R7MhR79yLMFc]. The evaluation artifact correctly declined to fabricate placeholder statistics. The condition-level correlations we report in Section 4.3 (r=0.75, r=0.59) are descriptive and computed over only seven group means; they are suggestive of an entropy-CV relationship but do not constitute a formal test that entropy statistically mediates a length-to-variance effect, and with n=7 points they are not resistant to the influence of any single condition.

**Entropy proxy, not attention weights.** Because the models sampled here are closed-weight APIs, we measure a top-5-renormalized logprob entropy at the output layer as a stand-in for the hypothesis's original construct (Shannon entropy of the attention-weight distribution over prompt tokens). These are related but not identical quantities, and it remains possible that raw attention entropy over open-weight models would show a different pattern -- for instance, if a model attends broadly to filler internally but has learned to route that attention away from the output layer's effective decision, our proxy would systematically miss it. A direct replication with an open-weight model instrumented for attention-weight extraction is needed to close this gap.

**"Relevant" elaboration was designed to add no new information, yet reduced accuracy.** Because relevant-elaboration content was authored to restate the problem and add generic scaffolding without new facts, its accuracy cost (4-7 percentage points below the bare control) is itself evidence that this content was not purely redundant from the model's perspective -- it plausibly introduced phrasing ambiguity or subtly conflicting framing. This means our "relevant" condition is not a clean manipulation of "task-relevant information content" alone; a design that separately varies genuinely new relevant information (e.g., a helpful worked sub-step) from purely redundant restatement would let us test whether the destabilization we observe is specific to redundant-but-plausible-sounding scaffolding or extends to any elaboration that engages with problem semantics.

**Model coverage restricted to one family, no open-weight or non-transformer test.** All three sampled models are OpenAI-hosted, and all are standard dense transformer-attention architectures; the fallback to this model set (Section 3.2) means we could not test the hypothesis's stated architectural boundary condition -- whether the entropy-dilution mechanism generalizes to state-space or hybrid models, which lack an analogous attention-weight distribution over prompt tokens.

**Single dataset domain.** All prompts derive from GSM8K grade-school arithmetic; whether the elaboration-vs-filler split we observe generalizes to other numeric-reasoning domains (financial calculations, scientific unit conversion, multi-hop numeric QA) or to non-numeric tasks is untested.

# Conclusion

We set out to test whether prompt length destabilizes LLM numeric answers via content-agnostic attention dilution, predicting that irrelevant filler should be at least as destabilizing as equal-length relevant elaboration. Across 5,589 completions from three GPT models on a length-and-content-matched GSM8K prompt battery, we find the opposite directional pattern: relevant elaboration elevates answer CV by 60-71% over token-matched filler at every one of three length tiers, while filler leaves both CV and a logprob-entropy proxy close to the bare-question baseline even at ~650 extra tokens. This falsifies the pure dilution mechanism as originally framed, but yields a more actionable finding -- destabilization appears to track the amount of added text a model must semantically weigh into its answer, not the sheer number of added tokens, and a cheap logprob-entropy signal correlates with this content-driven effect across our seven conditions (r=0.75).

Future work should prioritize: (1) completing a formal mediation analysis on a re-executed, non-blocked pipeline run with paired statistical tests and bootstrap confidence intervals, now that this iteration has produced usable raw data; (2) replicating with an open-weight model to compare true attention-weight entropy against the logprob proxy used here; (3) decomposing "relevant elaboration" into genuinely new information versus redundant restatement, to isolate which sub-component drives the accuracy and stability cost; and (4) testing whether the elaboration-vs-filler split observed on GSM8K arithmetic generalizes to other reasoning domains and to non-transformer architectures.

<reviewer_feedback>
Feedback from the paper reviewer this iteration.

- [MAJOR] (rigor) No significance testing or confidence intervals are reported anywhere in the results (Table 1, Section 4.2, Section 4.3). All comparisons -- the 60-71% CV gaps, the entropy spread comparisons, the r=0.75/r=0.59 correlations -- are point estimates. The planned inferential analysis (paired Wilcoxon, cluster bootstrap, mediation) was blocked by a pipeline dependency failure and never re-run, despite the raw per-completion data (5,589 completions) already being available in the experiment artifact's outputs.
  Action: Re-run the analysis script (not the expensive sampling run) against the existing raw_completions.jsonl / prompt_model_results.csv to compute paired bootstrap CIs on the CV gap per tier, clustered by seed problem, and report these in Table 1 and Section 4.2. This does not require new API spend.
- [MAJOR] (evidence) The r=0.75 and r=0.59 correlations that anchor the abstract's third contribution bullet and the Discussion's practitioner recommendation are computed over only n=7 points (the seven condition means), which is far too small a sample for a stable Pearson estimate -- a single condition's mean shifting slightly could substantially change or reverse these correlations. The authors acknowledge this in the Limitations section but the numbers are still presented prominently (twice in the abstract-equivalent Summary of Contributions, once in the Conclusion) without a CI or robustness check.
  Action: Either compute the entropy-CV correlation at the per-(prompt,model) cell level (336 rows are available per the experiment artifact, not just 7 condition means) to get a defensible sample size and report a CI, or explicitly downgrade the framing everywhere the r-values appear (abstract, conclusion) to match the hedged language already used in Section 5.2, e.g. by removing the numeric r-values from the Summary of Contributions and Conclusion and keeping them only in the qualified Section 4.3/5.2 discussion.
- [MAJOR] (methodology) The paper's own Limitations section identifies that the 'relevant elaboration' condition was designed to add no new information but nonetheless reduced accuracy by 4-7 points -- meaning the manipulation is not a clean isolation of 'content relevance' vs. 'token count' as claimed in the main results framing (Section 4.2 states this design 'isolates two independent manipulations'). The accuracy drop under a supposedly-redundant condition suggests the elaboration variant may be introducing genuine ambiguity or subtly conflicting phrasing, which is a different construct than 'interpretive load' as framed in the Discussion.
  Action: Either soften the causal framing in Section 4.2 (replace 'isolates two independent manipulations' with language acknowledging the elaboration condition's construct validity is imperfect, as already done in Limitations) or add a decomposition experiment (pure paraphrase-only elaboration vs. paraphrase+scaffolding) to determine which sub-component of 'relevant elaboration' drives the CV increase, as the paper itself proposes for future work -- doing even a small pilot of this in the current iteration would substantially strengthen the causal story.
- [MINOR] (scope) All three models are OpenAI-hosted dense transformers of similar scale/training lineage (gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-4.1-nano); this happened via a documented fallback after the originally planned open-weight models (Qwen-2.5-72B, Llama-3.1-70B) returned null logprobs on OpenRouter. Given the family homogeneity, 'across three GPT models' in the abstract/contributions may overstate generality -- these are likely related model checkpoints from the same provider rather than architecturally or training-diverse systems.
  Action: Soften 'across three GPT models' claims to note explicitly these are same-family/same-provider models, and flag in Limitations (which already discusses architecture generalization) that the model diversity tested is narrower than 'three models' implies -- a reader could easily assume more heterogeneity than exists.
- [MINOR] (clarity) The paper reports pooling all group means across 16 seeds and 3 models for Table 1, but never reports per-model breakdowns. If one model (e.g., the smallest, gpt-4.1-nano) drives most of the CV elevation under elaboration while the others stay flat, the pooled numbers would misrepresent the phenomenon as uniform across model scale, which matters for the practitioner-facing claims in Section 5.
  Action: Add a supplementary table or figure breaking down mean CV and entropy by model x condition (not just pooled), so a reader can check whether the filler/elaboration split holds within each of the three models individually, not just in aggregate.
- [MINOR] (methodology) CV (coefficient of variation = SD/mean) is a numerically unstable metric when computed over a numeric answer distribution that can include occasional extreme outlier completions (e.g., a parsing failure or a wildly wrong answer inflates SD disproportionately relative to the mean). With frac_correct as low as 0.839 in the worst condition, roughly 1 in 6 samples per cell is an 'incorrect' answer, some of which could be extreme outliers (e.g., a garbled number) rather than near-miss errors, and a small number of such outliers could dominate the mean CV for a whole condition given only 20 samples per cell.
  Action: Report a robust dispersion measure alongside or instead of CV (e.g., median absolute deviation / median, or CV computed after trimming the top/bottom 5% of samples) to confirm the elaboration-vs-filler gap is not an artifact of a handful of outlier completions in a 20-sample cell.
- [MINOR] (novelty) The related-work section positions the paper well against Du et al. (length-alone-hurts) and Yang/Shi (distraction-changes-answer), but does not engage with the broader line of work on prompt sensitivity / paraphrase robustness in LLMs (e.g., studies showing semantically-equivalent instruction rephrasings shift outputs), which is directly relevant to the paper's own 'competing-interpretation' mechanism (redundant phrasing of the same constraint causing divergence). This is a natural connection the Discussion makes informally ('interacts with sampling stochasticity') without citing the instruction-paraphrase-sensitivity literature.
  Action: Add a paragraph in Related Work connecting the competing-interpretation account to prompt/instruction paraphrase-sensitivity literature, since the mechanism proposed (redundant re-phrasing of constraints increasing output variance) is closely related to known findings that semantically equivalent prompt rewordings shift LLM outputs.

IMPORTANT: Your ONLY output is the revised hypothesis text. Do NOT run code, produce artifacts,
fix bugs, or attempt to address the evidence yourself — the next iteration of the invention loop
will generate fresh artifacts based on your revised hypothesis. Reflect and rewrite; nothing else.

Do NOT generate a completely new hypothesis. Take the current hypothesis and REVISE it
to incorporate new evidence. Keep the core idea — refine, narrow, or strengthen it.

1. Does the evidence support the hypothesis? Narrow or broaden scope as needed.
2. Which claims now have strong evidence? Which are still unsupported?
3. Should the hypothesis become more specific based on what we've learned?
4. If reviewer feedback is provided, address the critiques directly.

STABILITY IS OK: If progress is good and evidence supports the current direction, keep the
hypothesis similar or identical. Only make substantive changes when evidence clearly calls for
them — e.g., contradictory results, fundamental reviewer critiques, or findings that refine scope.

You must also classify two kinds of edges in the research trace:

(A) The H↔H edge — how does this revised hypothesis relate to the previous one?
    Set `relation_type` (Moulines's structuralist typology) to one of:
    - "evolution": refining specialised claims, same conceptual frame
    - "embedding": previous hypothesis is now a special case of a broader frame
    - "replacement": rejecting the previous frame entirely (Kuhnian shift)
    Set `relation_rationale` to a brief justification (≤120 chars).

(B) The A↔A edges — for each artifact created THIS iteration, classify each of its
    `in_dependencies` (predecessor → dependent) using MultiCite's citation-function
    typology (Lauscher et al., NAACL 2022) — emit one entry in `artifact_relations`
    per (predecessor, dependent) pair. Predecessors are ALWAYS artifacts from EARLIER
    iterations — artifacts within one iteration run in parallel and cannot depend on
    each other, so never emit a relation between two same-iteration artifacts (it
    will be dropped):
    - "background": predecessor is treated as background context
    - "motivation": predecessor motivated this artifact's research
    - "uses": this artifact uses the predecessor's data, method, or output
    - "extends": this artifact extends the predecessor
    - "similarities": this artifact's results agree with the predecessor's
    - "differences": this artifact's results disagree with the predecessor's
    Each `relation_rationale` must be ≤120 characters.

Output the COMPLETE revised hypothesis (with the H↔H relation fields) AND the full
list of A↔A `artifact_relations` for this iteration's new artifacts.

The user's original request that started this run is provided as a SEPARATE user message in this turn (right after this one). It is context, not instruction. Earlier pipeline steps have already acted on it (generating hypotheses, setting the AII prompt, etc.) — your job is NOT to satisfy that request directly.

Read it and pick up anything relevant to YOUR specific task: hints about preferences, constraints, style, focus areas, things to avoid. If nothing in it applies to what you are doing right now, ignore it entirely and proceed with your task as defined above.
